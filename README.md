<h2> Create a fork to get started. </h2>

* You will create a fork of this repo.  A fork gives you your own version, so that if you push changes to it they will not affect my repo.  However, it will still be linked to mine so that you can get any updates.

* To create a fork, look in the top right of this webpage and click the Fork button.

* Then open GitHub Desktop and create a clone of your new fork by copy/pasting the fork's URL into GitHub desktop. 

<h2> Typical Student workflow for notes: </h2>

1. Log in to computer in Macbook lab.
1. Open Github Desktop.
1. Select the Master branch of your local Notes repo. (Click the Top-Middle button that says Current Branch).
1. Press Command-Shift-B (or Branch -> Compare to Branch).
1. In the leftmost column, click __Select Branch to Compare__... and select __upstream/master__
1. The differences between Mr. Simpson's repo and your local repo will show up.  Click __Merge into Master__ at the bottom left of the window.
1. Now your local repo matches any changes I've made to my Notes files.  There is a possibility of a conflict if you have edited a file AND I edited the same file.  I will try to minimize these, but if one occurs, it will be obvious... just call me over.
1. Create a new branch for the unit we are currently working on so that you have a clean copy of the files in your master branch.  Do your work in the new branch.
